Reinforcement learning is the branch of machine learning that deals with this type of sequential decision making. The algorithm receives a rewards when outcomes are good and incurs costs (negative rewards) when they are bad. The objective of the algorithm is to maximize expected future rewards possibly with discounting.

The exploitation/exploration trade-off plays a central role to reinforcement learning. We have been considering a decay factor $\beta$ that reduces the probability of exploration on trial.
